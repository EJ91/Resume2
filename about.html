<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a 32 year old student Web Developer. I have previous experience working for the Department of Correction, Inland Revenue NZ, and First Security NZ. I have a passion for social work, IT, and personal training.</p>

<p>In my spare time I like to watch boxing, basketball, tennis, and mixed martial arts. I enjoy going to the beach, and spending time with my friends. I like to read books and expand my understanding of an array of various topics.</p>

<p>In the future I hope to have a successful career in Web Development, and eventually learn the necessary skills to work in cybersecurity to prevent cybercrime.</p>
